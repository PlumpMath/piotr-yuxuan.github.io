> The first character 華 of the project name means sinity; 文 stands for language. The whole phrase 華文 means _Chinese language_ and is read ㄏㄨㄚˊ ㄨㄣˊ or huáwén.

That page doesn't contain much details about that project. If reading bores you, watch to [some pictures](https://www.github.com/{{ site.links.github | append: "/chinese-huawen" | append: "/tree/master/gephi" }}) of what I had got ☺ The [git repository](https://www.github.com/{{ site.links.github | append: "/chinese-huawen" }}) explains how to get started and expose the code. The [gh-pages](/chinese-huawen) branch contains some lengthy description of this project.

## What's the most efficient way to learn Chinese?

Chinese language is not like most of Western languages: a Chinese character like 貴 can be meaningful by its own whereas Western _z_ means nothing by itself. Chinese is a very different thus very interesting language.

Most of Chinese handbooks are built in a Western fashion: daily-life conversation samples bring new vocabulary and syntax examples. This fashion doesn't take advantage of intrinsic Chinese language structure, which makes easier to discover 貴 when knowing yet 中, 一 and 貝. 貴 stands for expensive or honourable while 貝 refers to shell or money. This semantic link lets it easy to remember both of them. The rational way to learn Chinese may be to learn components before compounds. Given that, the most efficient way may be to order Chinese character by frequency.

That page extends the previous example and widen its scope step by step. We initially focus on a single sinogram sructure and then broaden the scope to sinogram composition directed network. We further foresee how to crawl it and retrieve data from it.
