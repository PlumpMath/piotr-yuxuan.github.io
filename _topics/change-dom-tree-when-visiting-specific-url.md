## Change <small>DOM</small> tree when visiting specific <small>URL</small>

Some news sites are interesting for their contents, not their style. If you visit them unaware, it's even difficult to read their free content peacefully because of ads they embed, panels and useless features they come with.

To throw all that rubbish out and get news site does its job -- giving you news, not delivering you ads -- it could be nice to have a browser add-on which is triggered by the <small>URL</small> and refactor the <small>DOM</small> tree: let's cleanse it from all unneeded content and just keep the core text.

I know Firefox comes with `about:reader` special tab. This project aims at mimmic this general tool but stays focused on some sites with a set of predefined rules.
