abstract_html: "<p>Chinese language is not like most of Western languages: a sinogram like 貴 can be meaningful by its own whereas Western <i>z</i> means nothing by itself. Chinese is a very different thus very interesting language. What's the most efficient way to learn characters?</p><p>The rational way may be to learn components before compounds. Given that, the most efficient way may be to order Chinese character by frequency. We initially focus on a single sinogram sructure and then broaden the scope to sinogram composition directed network. We further foresee how to crawl it and retrieve data from it.</p>"
