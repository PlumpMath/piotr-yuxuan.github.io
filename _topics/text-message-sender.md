I was used to Google calendar and made heavy use of text messages notifications for various purposes. Google stops to provide us this service, thank you. I believe it shouldn't be that difficult to set up a <small>GNU</small>/Linux server on a tiny Raspberry Pi, connect it to the network and give it a simple <small>API</small> to allow sending reminders. It would cost be nothing because my phone plan provider exposes an handy <small>API</small> to send text messages to my phone number over the network. 

A further improvement would be to install a calendar software on this server and bind the two with a plugin. Such plugin would basically send a <small>POST</small> message to an <small>URI</small> when an evetn is triggered: it may be reachable from my humble skills ~
