## Learning Clo<i>j</i>ure

The more I learn about Clo<i>j</i>ure, the more I feel I never knew what « being a developer » truly means before. Functionnal paradigm is so very powerful! Clo<i>j</i>ure is beautiful. It demands a very fresh new mindset from what I've been taught before. I believe all computer students should start to code within the functional frame. Then, if they prefer, they could downgrade their mind to model-driven, aspect-, actor-, object- or even imperative-oriented programming.

Hereafter follow some exercices I've been suggested and the response I've had from them.
