I don't know whether you've ever tried to find yourself your own way in Parisian public transportation network[^1].

For basic needs, you can ask [ratp.fr](ratp.fr). The site is ugly and wouldn't be of great help, except to throw away: a lot of ads, mis-used JavaScript and 167 errors in <small>XHTML</small> 1.0 according to the [<small>W</small>3<small>C</small> validator](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=ratp.fr&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0). You would'nt feel the power of disruptive techs even 20 years ago… Anyway, despite this bad, it can more or less help you in finding the shortest way between two spots.

When asking for something more demanding, just forget everything about any help from the French governement. For example, have you ever wondered which path would give you the best probability to have a seat during your whole journey? It's not that difficult, you can consider to hop in a vehicule the closer from the starting point the better. [Ratp.fr](ratp.fr) is tailored for the most common use then you simply have to give a map a glance and plan your journey yourself.

Such map isn't provided by the governement.

Yes, really, it simply doesn't exist. Exists an ugly Flash-powered so-called [« interactive » map](http://www.ratp.fr/plan-interactif/) with a big advertisment for Disney resort but it's only for Paris. Exists low-resolution map picture of Paris buses, undergrounds and tramways, but it's only Paris. Doesn't exist a map showing all buses of « Ile de France »; one French over six live in this area and the government simply provide them any maps for moving from the suburbs to Paris by buses. The <small>STIF</small>, the public entity in charge of transportation in Ile de France, run with around [€6 billions of income](http://www.stif.org/organisation-et-missions/le-volet-economique/le-budget-du-stif.html) each year and they can't simply give you a map. There is big money but not Big Data. <small>LOL</small>. 

Fortunately, open innovation ensures some citizens to give from their time and money to create open street map. Actually I've found two maps, thanks to the dedicated [wiki article](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_France/Bus_RATP):

 * [http://demo.3liz.com/osmtransport/index.php?country=1&location=1](http://demo.3liz.com/osmtransport/index.php?country=1&location=1)

With a [£60.000 big crowdfunding](http://donate.openstreetmap.org/server2015/) and free software, they can provide a worldwide first-class cartography service. It's somewhat detailed as [you can see here](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/49.7423/142.8347). This is globally funded by only two people, for $20.000 each: Mapbox and Mapzen. Their currency suggest they could be from the United Stated. Thanks to them for replacing French state where it fails.

Open innovation helps the France inhabitant for basic things like finding a way or having a look at a map. As we've seen elsewhere, France government is [currently harshly fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber_(company)#UberPop_and_UberPool_in_Paris_and_New_York) against it. <small>GG</small> Monsieur H<small>OLLANDE</small>.

[^1]: Actually I dislike to write billets but I'm used to do so when upset. I shouldn't be pessimistic and say this article is #1 of a series but I've been living in that country, I know it'll show me I'm one hundred percent right ><
