## Hello, brave new world!

As a first post, this will be a to-do reminder of what I still have to do to fit theme to my need.

 * Add custom font for Asian characters;
 * Let the title be big for home and reduce when scrolling until a certain point. Let also the title be small for other layouts;
 * Fix paginator;
 * Suggest brijeshb42 to empty the repository and populate gh-pages as it would allow followers to keep up to date in a cleaner way;
 * Make index crawl a folder and display an abstract of each project introduction pages;
 * Add an nested list item in the header list to link to projects more easily;
 * Look about writing posts in $\LaTeX{}$ and export them in md with pandoc with correct tags and structure;
 * Do something to make the title bigger when no scrolled yet and reduce it when scrolling to save place (at least for home page);
 * Add fix background picture to the heading area; 
 * Write a Makefile to automate local and remote deployments and pre-processing (if some part needs to be spread amongst all gh-pages, make will symblink it in local and hard copy at push);
 * Fix the trouble with sharing buttons or delete them.
