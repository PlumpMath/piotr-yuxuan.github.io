This text uses <small>utf</small>-8 characters. Without proper rendering support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols such like `è²´` instead of a sinogram. Wikipedia has a [help entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Special_characters) for you to solve any problems you may stumble upon. Western words are typed in Libre Baskerville. Chinese characters are rendered with the Kaiti style font AR PL UKai TW MBE. Consider downloading [the font file](/fonts/AR-PL-UKai-TW-MBE.ttf) to speed up rendering.

Mathematical formulæ rely on [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) and seem $$\mathrm{not}$$ to be currently hidden. It depends on whether you can reach MathJax [site](http://www.mathjax.org/). If you browse through Tor, switching to a new Tor identity may temporarily solve your problem.
