## Being an engineer

As I'm using java for my daily life, I want to keep being a student and 
A list of DSL for clojures
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3968055/are-there-any-clojure-dsls

So my learning path hasn't started from imperative programming, excepted TI-BASIC I used with a calculator. C has not been my first language and I've never felt confident with it.

 * Java 7 has introduced me to object-oriented programming;
 * VHDL
 * Java 8 and C# has let me guess the marvel of functional programming, even if it's somewhat limited;
 * By now I'm getting attracted to Clojure and its functional paradigm
 * I've known actor-based paradigm a bit thanks to akka but it's somewhat limited so I'd prefer to discover this paradigm more in-depth with quasar and pulsar.
 * Clojure and quasar will help me know more and transactional software memory and concurrent programming
 * Then I'll dive into logic programming.
 * Thanks with Clojure, I plan to get interested in matrix programming

At the end of that whole path, I will say myself an engineer: by know I'm just a late student or a brogrammer.

constraint programming → trammel
relational programming, constraint logic programming, and nominal logic programming → core.logic
logic for robots → mini-kanren
