The character œê (cursive Greek beta) stands for hand-made, always-in-progress work thus don't be surprised by bugs, lacks or so on: the very purpose of this site is to highlight then reduce them. 

This page is not about revealing to the world my splendid masterwork lol -- I just do this as a hobby. It's more about an exercice to express and explain ideas. I believe this can be very helpful for me to make my mind clearer.

This is the home page. The menu links to a global overview of topics I'm interested in and further introduction to each of them. You could also access some billets -- if I would ever publish any of them.
